🧩 Description

This project implements the “3D Balance Ball” scenario using Unity ML-Agents.
The agent (the ball) learns to stay balanced on a tilting platform by applying controlled forces based on its observations.

🔍 Key Features

Integration with Unity ML-Agents

Control policy based on learned behavior

Includes training and evaluation scenarios

Modular project structure (Project, config, etc.)
